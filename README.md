A comprehensive, self-paced AI bootcamp curriculum based on the **Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (4th Edition)** textbook. This roadmap covers the full spectrum of AI, from classical search and logic to modern deep learning, reinforcement learning, and Large Language Model (LLM) agents.

## 📚 Course Overview

This curriculum is structured into **4 Phases** spanning 104 weeks. It balances rigorous theory reading with practical Python implementation, mini-projects, and a capstone system integration.

- **Phase I:** Foundations and Classical AI Implementation (Weeks 1–26)
- **Phase II:** Advanced Core AI and Deep Learning Foundation (Weeks 27–52)
- **Phase III:** Generative AI Specialization (Weeks 53–78)
- **Phase IV:** Operationalization, Trust, and Agents (Weeks 79–104)
