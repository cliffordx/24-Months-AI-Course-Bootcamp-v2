## Week 23 – Exact and approximate inference in BNs

- **Reading:** Chapter 13 sections on **variable elimination** and approximate inference (likelihood weighting, Gibbs sampling—conceptually).[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- **Coding / exercises:**

   - Implement variable elimination for your BN and compare runtime or operation counts to naive enumeration on several queries.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

   - If comfortable, implement likelihood weighting to approximate P(Rain∣WetGrass)P(\\text{Rain} \\mid \\text{WetGrass})P(Rain∣WetGrass) and compare approximate vs. exact results.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- **Reflection:** Write about trade‑offs between exact and approximate inference (speed, accuracy, complexity) and when you would choose each in a real system.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​
