## Week 12 – CSP heuristics and propagation

- Reading: Chapter 6, MRV/degree/LCV heuristics and forward checking; optionally start AC‑3 section.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- Goals:

   - Understand how variable and value ordering reduces search dramatically.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- Coding:

   - Add MRV and forward checking to your CSP solver and compare node counts on harder Sudoku.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

   - If time, add AC‑3 and measure additional pruning.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- Reflection: End‑of‑quarter review: quick summaries of search, games, and CSPs, plus a list of concepts that still feel shaky to revisit later.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​
