## Week 18 – Logic + KR consolidation week

- **Reading:** Light review of Chapters 7–10; re‑read any sections that felt difficult (e.g., resolution, Skolemization, or description logics).[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- **Coding / exercises:**

   - Refactor your logic code into a small **logic toolkit**: propositional inference (TT, chaining, resolution), UNIFY, and a simple Horn‑clause backward‑chainer.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

   - Add at least one new example domain (e.g., course planning KB) and test your toolkit on queries.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- **Reflection:** Produce a “Logic and KR” concept map linking: KB agents, propositional logic, FOL, ontologies, and where these would plug into larger AI systems (search, planning, or LLM‑hybrid agents).[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​
