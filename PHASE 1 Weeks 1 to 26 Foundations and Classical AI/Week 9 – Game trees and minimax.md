## Week 9 – Game trees and minimax

- Reading: Chapter 5 up to basic minimax for deterministic, zero‑sum, perfect‑information games.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- Goals:

   - Understand evaluation of game trees and notion of optimal play in two‑player games.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- Coding:

   - Implement minimax for tic‑tac‑toe with a simple static evaluation function.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

   - Add a random player and let them play many games to check correctness.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​
