## Week 3 – BFS and DFS

- Reading: Chapter 3, uninformed search: breadth‑first search, depth‑first search, tree vs. graph search.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- Goals:

   - Be able to explain completeness and optimality for BFS vs. DFS and their time/space use in terms of branching factor bbb and depth ddd.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- Coding:

   - Implement BFS and DFS in your own code (even if aima‑python has versions) and test on grid and 8‑puzzle.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

   - Log number of expanded nodes and solution depth for a few test cases.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- Math refresher: Review Big‑O notation and simple exponential growth O(bd)O(b^d)O(bd) in your notes.[pageplace+1](https://api.pageplace.de/preview/DT0400.9781292401171_A41586057/preview-9781292401171_A41586057.pdf)​
