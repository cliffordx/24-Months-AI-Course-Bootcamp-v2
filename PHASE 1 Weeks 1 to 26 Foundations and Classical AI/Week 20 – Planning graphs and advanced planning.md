## Week 20 – Planning graphs and advanced planning

- **Reading:** Chapter 11 sections on planning graphs (Graphplan idea), partial‑order planning, and planning as SAT/CSP (you can skim proofs, focus on intuition).[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- **Coding / exercises:**

   - Add a simple **plan‑length heuristic** (e.g., relaxed planning) or call a SAT solver on a toy SATPlan encoding for a small planning problem.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

   - Experiment with different problem instances and compare plan length and planning time between your forward planner and the SAT‑based or heuristic method.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- **Reflection:** Short essay on how planning relates to logical agents and CSPs, and how it might interact with an LLM front‑end in your future capstone.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​
