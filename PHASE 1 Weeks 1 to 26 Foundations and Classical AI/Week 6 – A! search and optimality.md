## Week 6 – A\* search and optimality

- Reading: Chapter 3, A\* search, admissible and consistent heuristics, and proof sketches.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- Goals:

   - Be able to explain why A\* with admissible heuristic is optimal in tree search and why consistency simplifies implementation.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- Coding:

   - Implement A\* with both heuristics used in Week 5 and compare against UCS on several instances.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

   - Visualize or tabulate open‑list sizes, expansions, and solution cost.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- Reflection: One page on trade‑offs between heuristic strength and computation cost for 8‑puzzle.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​
