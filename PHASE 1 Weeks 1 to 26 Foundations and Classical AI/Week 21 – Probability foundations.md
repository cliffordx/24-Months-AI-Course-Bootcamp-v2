## Week 21 – Probability foundations

- **Reading:** Chapter 12 “Quantifying Uncertainty” through the basics of probability, joint distributions, conditional probability, and Bayes’ rule.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- **Coding / exercises:**

   - Implement simple functions to compute joint, marginal, and conditional probabilities from finite tables.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

   - Build a small example (e.g., rain–sprinkler–wet‑grass) and verify Bayes’ rule numerically in code.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- **Math refresher / reflection:** Derive Bayes’ rule yourself in your notes and write a short paragraph explaining independence vs. conditional independence with examples.[lib.ysu+1](http://lib.ysu.am/disciplines_bk/efdd4d1d4c2087fe1cbe03d9ced67f34.pdf)​
