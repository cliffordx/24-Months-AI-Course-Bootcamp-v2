## Week 24 – Probabilistic reasoning mini‑project and review

- **Reading:** Light review of Chapters 12–13; skim any remaining examples or applications you skipped earlier.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- **Coding / exercises:**

   - Build a **small BN‑based application**: for example, symptom‑based diagnosis, sensor fusion for a robot, or a user‑preference model; support multiple different queries and interventions.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

   - Add a script that runs several queries and prints explanations of results (e.g., which variables most influence the probability).[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- **Reflection:** Produce a “Probability and BNs” summary page describing how uncertainty, BNs, and planning could later connect to your RL and LLM‑based capstone agent.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​
