## Week 4 – Uniform‑cost search and weekly wrap

- Reading: Finish uninformed search section in Chapter 3, including uniform‑cost search and discussion of search strategies.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- Goals:

   - Understand when UCS differs from BFS and why it is optimal with positive step costs.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- Coding:

   - Add UCS using a priority queue to your search module and test on a weighted grid.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

   - Create a table comparing BFS/DFS/UCS on several problems (solution cost, nodes expanded, memory used).[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- Reflection: Write half a page answering “When would I use UCS over BFS in a real system?” using examples.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​
