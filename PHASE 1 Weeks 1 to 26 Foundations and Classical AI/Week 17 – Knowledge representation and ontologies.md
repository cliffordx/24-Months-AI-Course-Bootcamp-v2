## Week 17 – Knowledge representation and ontologies

- **Reading:** Chapter 10 “Knowledge Representation” sections on ontological engineering, taxonomies, semantic networks, and description logics.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- **Coding / exercises:**

   - Design a small ontology for a concrete domain (e.g., properties, clients, and transactions in real‑estate) with classes, subclasses, and key relations.[lib.ysu+1](http://lib.ysu.am/disciplines_bk/efdd4d1d4c2087fe1cbe03d9ced67f34.pdf)​

   - Implement a simple semantic‑network or description‑logic–style representation and support queries like “list all premium customers” or “all residential properties.”[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- **Reflection:** Write about when a carefully designed symbolic KB is preferable to learning everything from data, referencing examples from the chapter.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​
