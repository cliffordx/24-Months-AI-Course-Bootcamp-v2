## Week 2 – Problem formulation and state spaces

- Reading: Chapter 3, sections “Problem‑solving agents” and “Example problems”; stop before uninformed search algorithms.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- Goals:

   - Formulate at least three different tasks as state‑space search problems (initial state, actions, transition model, goal test, path cost).[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

   - Understand how abstraction chooses which details go into the state.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- Coding: Write simple “problem” classes for a grid pathfinding task and the 8‑puzzle, even if you have not coded search yet.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- Reflection: One page on how modeling decisions change difficulty (e.g., 4‑connected vs. 8‑connected grid).[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​
