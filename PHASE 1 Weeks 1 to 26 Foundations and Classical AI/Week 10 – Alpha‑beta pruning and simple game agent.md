## Week 10 – Alpha‑beta pruning and simple game agent

- Reading: Chapter 5, alpha‑beta pruning and discussion of cut‑offs and move ordering.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- Goals:

   - Be able to explain when alpha‑beta prunes and why it does not affect final decision.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- Coding:

   - Extend your game agent with alpha‑beta and depth limits.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

   - Measure nodes evaluated with and without alpha‑beta on the same game states.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- Reflection: Write a short note on how evaluation functions approximate “lookahead to the end,” and limitations of shallow search.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​
