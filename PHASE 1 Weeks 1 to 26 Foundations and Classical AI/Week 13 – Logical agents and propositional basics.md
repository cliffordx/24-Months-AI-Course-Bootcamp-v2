## Week 13 – Logical agents and propositional basics

- **Reading (1–2 sessions):** Chapter 7 “Logical Agents” up through propositional syntax, semantics, and the KB‑agent architecture.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- **Coding / exercises (1–2 sessions):**

   - Implement truth‑table–based model checking for propositional sentences, using a small set of atomic propositions.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

   - Encode a tiny domain (e.g., “it is raining,” “ground is wet”) and verify entailment relationships by exhaustive truth tables.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- **Reflection (short write‑up):** In ½–1 page, explain how a **knowledge‑based agent** differs from the search agents you built earlier and what benefits/limitations it has.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​
