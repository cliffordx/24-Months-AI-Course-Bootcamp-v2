## Week 15 – First‑order logic: syntax and semantics

- **Reading:** Chapter 8 “First‑Order Logic” up to and including syntax (constants, functions, predicates, quantifiers) and basic semantics/models.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- **Coding / exercises:**

   - Design a small FOL vocabulary for a domain you care about (e.g., real‑estate listings, courses and prerequisites, or family relations).[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

   - Write code to represent FOL sentences as data structures (e.g., abstract syntax trees) and pretty‑print them.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- **Reflection:** Write a short note comparing what can be expressed in propositional logic vs. FOL, using concrete examples from your chosen domain.[lib.ysu+1](http://lib.ysu.am/disciplines_bk/efdd4d1d4c2087fe1cbe03d9ced67f34.pdf)​
