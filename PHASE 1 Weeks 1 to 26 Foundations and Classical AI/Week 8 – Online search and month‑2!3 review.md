## Week 8 – Online search and month‑2/3 review

- Reading: Chapter 4, online search and learning‑real‑time A\*; skim rest of chapter to see broader landscape.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- Goals:

   - Understand idea of acting and learning in unknown state spaces without an upfront map.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- Coding:

   - Implement a simple LRTA\*‑like agent for a grid world where walls are initially unknown.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

   - Compare total steps and path quality to an offline A\* agent that knows the full map.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- Reflection: Write a one‑page “Search so far” summary, linking BFS/DFS/UCS/A\*/local search/online search and when each is appropriate.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​
