## Week 14 – Propositional inference and Wumpus world

- **Reading:** Finish Chapter 7 sections on forward and backward chaining, resolution, and the Wumpus‑world example.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- **Coding / exercises:**

   - Implement forward chaining and backward chaining for propositional Horn clauses, and test on small rule sets.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

   - Build a propositional KB for a tiny Wumpus‑style world and show that your inference engine can derive which squares are safe.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- **Reflection:** Summarize the differences between model checking, chaining, and resolution in terms of efficiency and applicability.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​
