## Week 19 – Classical planning and search

- **Reading:** Chapter 11 “Automated Planning” sections on STRIPS/PDDL, forward state‑space search, regression, and basic planning heuristics.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- **Coding / exercises:**

   - Define a simple PDDL‑like data format or Python structures for actions (preconditions/effects) and states in a Blocks‑World or logistics domain.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

   - Implement a forward‑search planner (e.g., A\* over state space) that uses your action schema to find plans from an initial state to a goal.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- **Reflection:** Compare classical planning to the search algorithms you studied earlier; what makes planning easier/harder than plain shortest‑path search?[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​
