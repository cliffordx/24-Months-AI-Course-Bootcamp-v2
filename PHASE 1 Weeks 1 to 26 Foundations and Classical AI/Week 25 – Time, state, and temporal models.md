## Week 25 – Time, state, and temporal models

- **Reading (1–2 sessions):** Chapter 14 “Probabilistic Reasoning over Time,” sections 14.1–14.2.1 (time and uncertainty, Markov assumption, transition and sensor models, filtering & prediction).[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- **Coding / exercises (1–2 sessions):**

   - Implement a simple **hidden Markov model (HMM)** for a small domain (e.g., robot in 1D corridor, or “umbrella/no‑umbrella” weather example) with explicit transition and sensor tables.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

   - Write a function to perform **filtering** (belief state update) step by step as new observations arrive, and log the belief over time.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- **Reflection:** In ½–1 page, explain what a **belief state** is, how it relates to the deterministic belief sets you saw in search/planning, and why Markov and sensor models are crucial.[lib.ysu+1](http://lib.ysu.am/disciplines_bk/b7707dde83ee24b2b23999b4df5fd988.pdf)​
