## Week 30 – Decision theory and utilities

- **Reading:** Chapter 16 “Making Simple Decisions,” sections on utility theory, preferences under uncertainty, and expected utility.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- **Coding / exercises:**

   - Implement small **decision networks** (influence diagrams) for scenarios such as medical test decisions or investment choices, with nodes for decisions, chance, and utility.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

   - Write a function to compute **expected utility** of each action and choose the MEU (maximum expected utility) action.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- **Reflection:** Describe how decision networks extend Bayesian networks and why utility is needed beyond probability to define rational action.[modanesh.github+1](https://modanesh.github.io/assets/Summary%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20A%20Modern%20Approach.pdf)​
