## Week 28 – Particle filters and temporal review

- **Reading:** Chapter 14 section 14.3 on **particle filtering** and approximate inference in temporal models; skim DBNs for context.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- **Coding / exercises:**

   - Implement a basic **particle filter** for your HMM/robot example and compare its belief estimates to exact filtering as you vary particle count.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

   - Run experiments showing how many particles are needed for acceptable accuracy on your examples.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- **Reflection:** Summarize Chapter 14 in a one‑page “temporal reasoning” sheet: Markov models, filtering, smoothing, Viterbi, particle filtering; when exact vs. approximate methods are appropriate.[aibars+1](https://www.aibars.net/en/library/open-learning-ai/details/728919185857581056)​
