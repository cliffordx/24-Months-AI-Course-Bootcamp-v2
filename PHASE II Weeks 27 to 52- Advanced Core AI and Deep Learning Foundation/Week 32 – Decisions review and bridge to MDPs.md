## Week 32 – Decisions review and bridge to MDPs

- **Reading:** Quick review of Chapter 16 and skim the opening of Chapter 17 “Making Complex Decisions,” focusing on sequential decision problems and the idea of policies.[aibars+1](https://www.aibars.net/en/library/open-learning-ai/details/728919185857581056)​

- **Coding / exercises:**

   - Take a simple sequential decision scenario (e.g., multi‑step investment or maintenance decisions) and manually model it as a sequence of decisions with states and utilities to see where an MDP formulation will help.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

   - Re‑use your decision‑network code to simulate a few sequences under different choices and observe cumulative utility.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- **Reflection:** One‑page “Decision theory” summary: expected utility, VoI, single‑step vs. sequential decisions, and where these ideas will show up again in reinforcement learning.[aibars+1](https://www.aibars.net/en/library/open-learning-ai/details/728919185857581056)​
