## Week 43 – Learning Bayesian networks

- **Reading:** Chapter 20 sections on **learning Bayesian networks** from data: parameter learning with known structure, and an overview of structure learning.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- **Coding / exercises:**

   - Take a small BN structure (e.g., from your earlier BN project) and implement **parameter learning** from i.i.d. data with counts and Dirichlet priors.[studylib+1](https://studylib.net/doc/25797353/table-of-contents-for-ai--a-modern-approach-3rd-edition)​

   - For a tiny domain, explore a handful of candidate structures manually (e.g., chain vs. fork vs. collider) and use scoring (e.g., likelihood or BIC) to pick a better structure.[kaggle+1](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aimaexercises/aima-20-learning-probabilistic-models)​

- **Reflection:** Write a short explanation of how learning BNs combines structure assumptions with data evidence, and how this blurs the line between “models from experts” and “models from data.”[pageplace+1](https://api.pageplace.de/preview/DT0400.9781292401171_A41586057/preview-9781292401171_A41586057.pdf)​
