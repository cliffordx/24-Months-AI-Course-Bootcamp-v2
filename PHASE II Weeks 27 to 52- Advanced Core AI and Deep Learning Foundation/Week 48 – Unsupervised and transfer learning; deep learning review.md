## Week 48 – Unsupervised and transfer learning; deep learning review

- **Reading:** Chapter 21 section 21.7 on **unsupervised learning and transfer learning**, including probabilistic PCA, autoencoders, and deep autoregressive models.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- **Coding / exercises:**

   - Implement or adapt a simple **autoencoder** for dimensionality reduction on a small dataset, and visualize reconstructed vs. original inputs.[aikosh.indiaai+1](https://aikosh.indiaai.gov.in/static/Deep+Learning+Ian+Goodfellow.pdf)​

   - Perform a small **transfer‑learning** experiment by fine‑tuning a pretrained CNN on a tiny custom dataset (even if just a few manually labeled images or a public subset).[scribd+1](https://www.scribd.com/document/905797212/Artificial-Intelligence-A-Modern-Approach-4th-Edition-Stuart-Russell-eBook-PDF-Full-Access)​

- **Reflection:** Produce a one‑page “Deep Learning” summary: MLPs, CNNs, RNNs/LSTMs, autoencoders, and transfer learning, and jot down where you see these ideas feeding directly into modern LLMs and deep NLP models you will study later.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/newchap00.pdf)​
