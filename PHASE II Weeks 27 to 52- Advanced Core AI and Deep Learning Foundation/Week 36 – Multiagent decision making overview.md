## Week 36 – Multiagent decision making overview

- **Reading:** Chapter 18 “Multiagent Decision Making,” sections on properties of multiagent environments, non‑cooperative game theory (normal‑form games, Nash equilibrium), and cooperative game theory overview.[aibars+1](https://www.aibars.net/en/library/open-learning-ai/details/728919185857581056)​

- **Coding / exercises:**

   - Implement simulations of simple **normal‑form games** like Prisoner’s Dilemma or coordination games, exploring different strategy profiles and computing payoffs and possible Nash equilibria.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

   - Create a small multiagent gridworld scenario where two agents must coordinate (e.g., avoid collisions or share resources) and experiment with fixed policies.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- **Reflection:** One‑page “MDPs and multiagent” summary: MDPs vs. games, cooperation vs. competition, and how these ideas will inform multiagent RL and LLM‑assisted multi‑tool agents later in your bootcamp.[aibars+1](https://www.aibars.net/en/library/open-learning-ai/details/728919185857581056)​
