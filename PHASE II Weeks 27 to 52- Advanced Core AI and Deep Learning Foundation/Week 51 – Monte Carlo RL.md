## Week 51 – Monte Carlo RL

- **Reading:** Chapter 22 section 22.4 on **Monte Carlo (MC) methods**, focusing on MC prediction and control with exploring starts or ε‑soft policies.aima.berkeley+1​

- **Coding:**

   - Implement **MC prediction** for state values VπV^\\piVπ in gridworld by averaging returns over episodes generated under a fixed exploratory policy.stonybrook+1​

   - Implement MC control to learn an ε‑soft optimal policy and track the value function and policy as learning progresses.stonybrook+1​

- **Reflection:** In your notes, compare MC methods with dynamic programming: what information they require (model vs. sampled experience), convergence speed, and variance.modanesh.github+1​
