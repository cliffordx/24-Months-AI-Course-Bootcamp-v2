## Week 52 – Temporal‑difference (TD) learning

- **Reading:** Chapter 22 section 22.5 on **TD learning**, especially TD(0) and its relationship to MC and DP.aima.berkeley+1​

- **Coding:**

   - Implement **TD(0) prediction** for a fixed policy in gridworld and compare its convergence and sample efficiency to MC prediction.stonybrook+1​

   - Visualize how the value function evolves during learning for both MC and TD(0) on the same problem.modanesh.github+1​

- **Reflection:** Write a short note explaining why TD methods are called “bootstrapping,” and discuss their bias–variance trade‑off relative to MC.aima.berkeley+1​
