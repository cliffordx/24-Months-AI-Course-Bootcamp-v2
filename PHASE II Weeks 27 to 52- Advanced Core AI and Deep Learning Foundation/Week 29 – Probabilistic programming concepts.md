## Week 29 – Probabilistic programming concepts

- **Reading:** Chapter 15 “Probabilistic Programming,” focusing on the motivation, syntax/semantics of probabilistic programs, and open‑universe models (you can skim heavy theory).[lib.ysu+2](http://lib.ysu.am/disciplines_bk/efdd4d1d4c2087fe1cbe03d9ced67f34.pdf)​

- **Coding / exercises:**

   - In Python (or a simple PPL like Pyro, Bean Machine, or similar), implement a tiny generative model such as “entities and citations” or “customers and purchases,” sampling from priors and conditionals.[lib.ysu+1](http://lib.ysu.am/disciplines_bk/efdd4d1d4c2087fe1cbe03d9ced67f34.pdf)​

   - Write code that performs basic inference by enumeration or Monte Carlo (e.g., rejection or importance sampling) for your tiny model.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- **Reflection:** In ½–1 page, explain how probabilistic programming differs from fixed BN structures and why it is powerful for problems where the number of entities is uncertain.[lib.ysu+1](http://lib.ysu.am/disciplines_bk/efdd4d1d4c2087fe1cbe03d9ced67f34.pdf)​
