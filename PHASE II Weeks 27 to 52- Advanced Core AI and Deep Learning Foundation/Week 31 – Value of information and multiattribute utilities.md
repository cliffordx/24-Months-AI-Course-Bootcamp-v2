## Week 31 – Value of information and multiattribute utilities

- **Reading:** Chapter 16 sections on **value of information (VoI)** and multiattribute utility functions; skim human judgment/irrationality discussion.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- **Coding / exercises:**

   - Extend one of your decision networks to include an optional information‑gathering action (e.g., buying an expert report or running a diagnostic test) and compute its **expected value of information**.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

   - For a real‑life decision (say picking a study path or a property investment), sketch a simple multiattribute utility model and translate it into code.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- **Reflection:** Write a short note on how VoI might influence an AI agent’s behavior in planning (e.g., when to explore vs. exploit in RL or ask an LLM for help).[aibars+1](https://www.aibars.net/en/library/open-learning-ai/details/728919185857581056)​
