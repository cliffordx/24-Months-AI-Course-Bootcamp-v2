## Week 37 – Learning as a rational activity

- **Reading (1–2 sessions):** Chapter 19 “Learning from Examples” sections 19.1–19.3 (learning agents, components of a learning system, forms of learning).[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- **Coding / exercises (1–2 sessions):**

   - Implement the **general learning framework**: a training loop that takes examples, updates a hypothesis (e.g., linear classifier or decision stump), and evaluates performance on a validation set.[aimacode.github+1](https://aimacode.github.io/aima-exercises/concept-learning-exercises/)​

   - Choose a simple dataset (e.g., 2‑D synthetic points or a small tabular dataset) and visualize the decision boundary evolving across epochs.[studylib+1](https://studylib.net/doc/25797353/table-of-contents-for-ai--a-modern-approach-3rd-edition)​

- **Reflection:** In ½–1 page, describe the components of a learning agent (performance element, critic, problem generator, learning element) and how they relate to the simpler agents from early chapters.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​
