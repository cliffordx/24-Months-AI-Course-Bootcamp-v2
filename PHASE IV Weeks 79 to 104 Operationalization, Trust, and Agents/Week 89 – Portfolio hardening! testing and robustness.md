## Week 89 – Portfolio hardening: testing and robustness

- **Reading (1–2 sessions):** Revisit AIMA’s discussions of robustness, adversarial conditions, and safety (especially in later chapters on RL, robotics, and ethics).studocu+2​

- **Coding / QA (1–2 sessions):**

   - Add **unit tests** and stress tests to both your main capstone and specialization project, focusing on boundary conditions, invalid inputs, and extreme parameter values.projectpro+1​

   - Introduce simple fuzzing or randomized scenarios (e.g., random goals, noisy observations, perturbed prompts) to see where systems fail.q3tech+1​

- **Reflection:** Create a brief “robustness report” that lists major failure modes you observed and how well your current checks/guardrails mitigate them.thoughtworks+1​
