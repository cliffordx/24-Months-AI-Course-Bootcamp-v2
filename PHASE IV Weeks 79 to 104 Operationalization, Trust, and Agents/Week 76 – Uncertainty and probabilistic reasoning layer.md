## Week 76 – Uncertainty and probabilistic reasoning layer

- **Reading:** Re‑read key parts of Chapters 12–14 and 20 that discuss probabilistic reasoning, BNs, HMMs, and learning probabilistic models.aima.berkeley+2​

- **Coding / design:**

   - Decide where **uncertainty** matters in your system (e.g., noisy user intent, uncertain outcomes, unreliable sensors) and specify a small BN or HMM that captures this piece.aima.berkeley+1​

   - Implement the BN/HMM component (exact or approximate inference) and expose a simple API to other modules (e.g., “estimate probability task is feasible” or “predict user state”).modanesh.github+1​

- **Reflection:** Write about how the probabilistic layer changes your agent’s decisions compared to a purely deterministic design and how it connects to the MDP/RL view of uncertainty.aima.berkeley+1​
