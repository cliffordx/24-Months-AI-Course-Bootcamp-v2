## Week 75 – Knowledge representation and constraints

- **Reading:** Review Chapters 7–10 on logical agents, FOL, and knowledge representation to choose what kind of symbolic state/constraint representation best fits your domain.aima.berkeley+1​

- **Coding / design:**

   - Implement a small **knowledge base or ontology** for your domain (e.g., tasks, resources, user preferences), with either propositional/FOL rules or a lightweight description‑logic‑style hierarchy.lib.ysu+1​

   - Integrate constraint checking or CSP components where appropriate (e.g., scheduling constraints, resource limits) using your earlier CSP toolkit.aima.berkeley+1​

- **Reflection:** In a short note, justify your choice of KR formalism and discuss how it cooperates with learned components (e.g., LLMs suggesting facts, ML models populating attributes).lib.ysu+1​
