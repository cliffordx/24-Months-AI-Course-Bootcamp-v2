## Week 78 – Supervised/ML components and data strategy

- **Reading:** Revisit key parts of Chapters 19–20 on learning from examples and learning probabilistic models, focusing on evaluation and generalization.aima.berkeley+1​

- **Coding / design:**

   - Identify 1–2 **supervised tasks** inside your system (e.g., classifying user requests, ranking options, risk prediction) and select appropriate models (trees, linear models, or small neural nets).aimacode.github+1​

   - Implement training/evaluation pipelines for these models and integrate them behind clean interfaces (e.g., “score_action”, “classify_intent”).aimacode.github+1​

- **Reflection:** Document your **data plan**: sources, labeling strategy, train/validation/test splits, and how you will avoid data leakage and overfitting in these components.moodle2425.up+1​
