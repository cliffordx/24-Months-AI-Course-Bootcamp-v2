## Week 84 – Polish, presentation, and retrospective

- **Reading:** No heavy new theory; only small lookbacks into any chapters you need to cite or clarify in your report/presentation.aima.berkeley+1​

- **Coding / polishing:**

   - Fix outstanding bugs, improve error messages, tidy APIs, and ensure your project can be run from a clean checkout with a simple command or notebook sequence.aibars+1​

   - Prepare a **slide deck or demo script** that walks through a live scenario, showing how the agent interprets a request, consults planners/learners, and uses the LLM for language interaction.guvi+1​

- **Reflection:** Conduct a formal **retrospective**: what worked and what didn’t in your 24‑month plan, which skills you now have (search, logic, planning, probability, ML/DL/RL, NLP, LLM integration), and what you want to deepen next (research, more systems, specialized domains).aima.berkeley+1​
