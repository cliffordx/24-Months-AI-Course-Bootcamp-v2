## Week 88 – Specialization extension: add a twist

- **Reading:** Skim AIMA’s “limitations/open problems” style remarks in the relevant chapter, plus one recent blog post or paper that pushes beyond the classical algorithm you just replicated.ijcai+2​

- **Coding / experiments:**

   - Modify your replicated algorithm in a small but meaningful way (e.g., new exploration schedule in RL, extra heuristic in planning, or small architectural tweak in an NLP model).projectpro+1​

   - Compare baseline vs. modified variant on at least two metrics and visualize results.moodle2425.up+1​

- **Reflection:** Write a short analysis explaining whether your twist actually helped and how you would design a more rigorous follow‑up if you had more time.datascience.duke+1​
