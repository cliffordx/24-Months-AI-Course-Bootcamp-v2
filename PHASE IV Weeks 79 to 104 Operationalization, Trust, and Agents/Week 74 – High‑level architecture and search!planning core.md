## Week 74 – High‑level architecture and search/planning core

- **Reading:** Skim Chapter 2 on agent architectures and re‑read the key sections of Chapter 11 on classical planning and search in planning domains.aima.berkeley+1​

- **Coding / design:**

   - Design the **system architecture diagram**: modules for perception/NLP, knowledge/constraints, planner or MDP/RL core, LLM interface, storage, and evaluation harness.pageplace+2​

   - Implement or refactor a planning/search core (A\* planner or PDDL‑like planner) tailored to your capstone domain, reusing earlier code where possible.aima.berkeley+1​

- **Reflection:** Write about how your agent’s loop (perceive–think–act) maps onto AIMA’s generic agent diagrams and where planning vs. reactive behavior will dominate.aima.berkeley+1​
