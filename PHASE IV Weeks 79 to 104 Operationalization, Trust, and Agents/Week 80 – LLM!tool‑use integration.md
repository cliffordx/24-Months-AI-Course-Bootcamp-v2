## Week 80 – LLM/tool‑use integration

- **Reading:** Supplement Chapter 24 with recent work on **LLM agents, tool use, and planning** so you understand how LLMs can call external tools or planners.arxiv+2​

- **Coding / design:**

   - Integrate an **LLM layer** (via an API or local model) that: (1) interprets user text into structured commands or goals, and/or (2) explains or critiques plans generated by your classical modules.arxiv+1​

   - Implement a small **tool‑calling protocol** where the LLM can trigger planner/DB/RL queries and your system logs these calls for analysis.github+1​

- **Reflection:** In 1–2 pages, reflect on the balance between LLM flexibility and the guarantees provided by your symbolic and RL components; list explicit guardrails (prompting, validation, constraints) you will enforce.arxiv+1​
