## Week 99 – First concrete open‑source contribution

- **Reading:** Skim the chosen repo’s [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), architecture docs, and a couple of existing pull requests to see project [norms.learn.microsoft](norms.learn.microsoft)\+1​

- **Practice:**

   - Implement or fix a **small, well‑scoped change**: e.g., add a test for an algorithm you know, fix a bug, or enhance documentation with explanations that tie back to AIMA chapters.github+1​

   - Open a pull request and respond to maintainer feedback, iterating until merged or clearly resolved.dlab.berkeley+1​

- **Reflection:** Record what surprised you (review comments, style expectations, CI checks) and how this changed your sense of “production‑ready” AI code vs. study code.pluralsight+1​
