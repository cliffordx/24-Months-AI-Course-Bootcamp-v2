## Week 101 – Teaching and knowledge transfer

- **Reading:** Skim AIMA’s chapter summaries and glossaries to identify 2–3 clusters of topics that make sense as mini‑courses (e.g., search + games, logic + planning, RL fundamentals).aima.berkeley+1​

- **Practice:**

   - Design and draft **one mini‑curriculum** (e.g., a 3–4 session workshop or blog series) for a topic you now understand well, with references to specific AIMA sections and your own code repositories.modanesh.github+1​

   - Optionally record a short explainer video or notebook walkthrough for one algorithm (like A\*, Q‑learning, or a simple BN).novascholar+1​

- **Reflection:** Note which explanations felt natural vs. hard; difficulty teaching is a strong signal of where to revisit the theory.modanesh.github+1​
