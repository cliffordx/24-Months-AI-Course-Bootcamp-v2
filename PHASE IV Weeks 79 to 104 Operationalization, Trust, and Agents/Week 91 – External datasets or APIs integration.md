## Week 91 – External datasets or APIs integration

- **Reading:** Skim sections of AIMA that discuss real‑world data and noisy environments (probabilistic reasoning, RL in robotics, NLP corpora) and complement with a tutorial on using a relevant external dataset or API.lib.ysu+2​

- **Coding / experiments:**

   - Hook your specialization or capstone to at least one **external dataset or API** (e.g., a real text corpus, open images, finance or weather API, or a domain‑specific knowledge base).q3tech+1​

   - Run experiments to see how performance and robustness change compared with synthetic or toy data.logicmojo+1​

- **Reflection:** Write about the “reality gap” between textbook tasks and messy real data, and what engineering work was needed (cleaning, monitoring, rate‑limit handling, etc.).novascholar+1​
