## Week 87 – Specialization core: literature replication

- **Reading (1–2 sessions):** Pick one concrete algorithm or system from your specialization area that AIMA references (e.g., a specific RL algorithm variant, a planning heuristic, or an NLP model) and read both AIMA’s description and at least one external source.modanesh.github+1​

- **Coding / experiments (1–2 sessions):**

   - Re‑implement this algorithm or subsystem cleanly, using your earlier code only as optional reference.aibars+1​

   - Run small experiments to reproduce at least one qualitative result from the source (e.g., a learning curve shape, search‑effort reduction, or accuracy gain).datacamp+1​

- **Reflection:** Document what matched the source and what didn’t, and what this teaches you about reading versus reproducing algorithmic descriptions.modanesh.github+1​
