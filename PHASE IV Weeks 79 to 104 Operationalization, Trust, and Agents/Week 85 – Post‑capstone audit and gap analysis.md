## Week 85 – Post‑capstone audit and gap analysis

- **Reading (1–2 sessions):** Skim AIMA’s summaries and bibliographic notes for the chapters most used in your capstone (likely 3–6, 7–11, 12–14, 17–22, 23–24, 26–27) to surface areas that still feel shallow.aima.berkeley+1​

- **Coding / review (1–2 sessions):**

   - Review all your major code modules (search, CSP, logic/KR, planning, probability, ML, DL, RL, NLP, LLM integration) and list concrete weaknesses or technical debt.lib.ysu+1​

   - Open GitHub issues or TODOs in each repo/file so you have a clear backlog.[projectpro](https://www.projectpro.io/article/artificial-intelligence-project-ideas/461)​

- **Reflection:** Write a 1–2 page “skills audit” mapping AIMA topics to your confidence level and project evidence, identifying a **specialization track** you want to deepen next (e.g., RL/agents, NLP/LLMs, planning/KR, or probabilistic modeling).dictionary.archivists+1​
