## Week 100 – Competitive or benchmark project

- **Reading (1–2 sessions):** Read guidelines for one competition/benchmark platform (e.g., Kaggle for ML, an RL benchmark, or an NLP shared task), focusing on evaluation and baselines.datacamp+1​

- **Practice (1–2 sessions):**

   - Enter a **small competition or benchmark** aligned with your skills (classification, RL control, or text tasks), starting with a strong baseline that implements ideas straight from AIMA (e.g., tree + ensemble, RL value iteration, simple seq‑to‑seq).projectpro+1​

   - Log results and systematically iterate 1–2 improvements (better features, hyperparameters, or a small neural upgrade).q3tech+1​

- **Reflection:** Write about how your textbook‑driven approach stacked up against common competition baselines and what this says about the gap between theory and leaderboard‑driven practice.datacamp+1​
