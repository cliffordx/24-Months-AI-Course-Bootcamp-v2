## Week 79 – NLP interface design (classical + neural)

- **Reading:** Review Chapters 23 and 24 sections on language understanding, dialog systems, and deep learning for NLP, focusing on input/output formats and pipelines.aima.berkeley+2​

- **Coding / design:**

   - Design the **NLP front‑end** for your system: tokenization, optional classical parsing/IE, and how user text will be transformed into structured goals, constraints, or queries.lib.ysu+1​

   - Implement a first version of this pipeline using traditional NLP tools or simple sequence models, leaving space to drop in an LLM later.aima.berkeley+1​

- **Reflection:** Write about what information you need from language (intent, entities, constraints), and how much of that should be handled symbolically vs. delegated to an LLM.lib.ysu+1​
