## Week 95 – Final knowledge consolidation

- **Reading (1–2 sessions):** Skim AIMA’s **chapter summaries and glossaries** across all parts and re‑read your own notes from early weeks (agents, search, logic, probability, learning).aima.berkeley+1​

- **Practice (1–2 sessions):**

   - Create a **personal cheat‑sheet / mind‑map** of the entire book: how each part (agents, problem solving, knowledge, uncertainty, learning, communicating/perceiving/acting) connects, with cross‑links to your projects.aima.berkeley+1​

   - Re‑implement one very small algorithm from an early chapter (e.g., A\*, AC‑3, or DPLL) from scratch without looking, as a self‑check.aimacode.github+1​

- **Reflection:** Write a one‑page “I can now…” statement listing concrete abilities tied to AIMA topics (e.g., “can implement X,” “can design Y,” “can evaluate Z”) to anchor your sense of progress.dictionary.archivists+1​
