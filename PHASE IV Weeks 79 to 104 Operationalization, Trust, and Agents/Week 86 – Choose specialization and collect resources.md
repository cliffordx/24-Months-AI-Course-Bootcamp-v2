## Week 86 – Choose specialization and collect resources

- **Reading:** Use AIMA’s references plus 2–3 external tutorials/papers in your chosen specialization (for example, RL agent planning surveys, LLM‑tool use papers, or advanced planning/verification).arxiv+2​

- **Coding / setup:**

   - Create a new “Specialization Project” repo or folder and scaffold it with a clear README, environment file, and data folder.github+1​

   - Pull in or refactor only the modules from your capstone that are relevant to this track to keep scope tight.logicmojo+1​

- **Reflection:** Write a short “project pitch” for this specialization project (problem, why it matters, which AIMA ideas it extends, and how it differs from the main capstone).datascience.duke+1​
