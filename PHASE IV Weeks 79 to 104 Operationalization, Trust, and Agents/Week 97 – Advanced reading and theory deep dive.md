## Week 97 – Advanced reading and theory deep dive

- **Reading (1–2 sessions):** Use the bibliographic notes at the end of AIMA 4e’s parts (especially learning, RL, NLP, multiagent, and ethics sections) to pick **2–3 classic or survey papers** that extend topics you liked most.aima.berkeley+2​

- **Practice (1–2 sessions):**

   - For each paper, write a 1–2 paragraph summary and relate it explicitly to the corresponding AIMA chapter (e.g., how a newer RL algorithm refines the Chapter 22 ideas).aima.berkeley+1​

   - Note any algorithms or concepts you might want to prototype later.stackoverflow+1​

- **Reflection:** Draft a “reading list” for the next 6–12 months (5–10 key papers/chapters) aligned with your chosen specialization track.datacamp+1​
