## Week 69 – Robotics foundations and hardware

- **Reading (1–2 sessions):** Chapter 26 “Robotics” sections on robot types, sensors/actuators, and the perception‑action loop.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- **Coding / exercises (1–2 sessions):**

   - Use a 2‑D simulator (or craft a simple one) to model a **mobile robot** navigating a grid or continuous plane with noisy sensors and actuators.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

   - Implement a basic control loop that repeatedly senses, updates a belief or state estimate, and chooses actions using a planner or RL policy you already coded.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- **Reflection:** Describe how robotics ties together perception, planning, and control, and how uncertainty in sensors/actuators makes robotics a natural home for the probabilistic tools you learned.[lib.ysu+1](http://lib.ysu.am/disciplines_bk/efdd4d1d4c2087fe1cbe03d9ced67f34.pdf)​
