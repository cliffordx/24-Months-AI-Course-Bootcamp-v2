## Week 63 – Information extraction and question answering

- **Reading:** Chapter 23 sections on **information extraction (IE)**, named‑entity recognition, relation extraction, and classical QA pipelines.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- **Coding / exercises:**

   - Build a small IE pipeline that takes raw text (e.g., news about housing or finance) and extracts entities and relations relevant to a domain of your choice.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

   - Implement a simple QA system over a small text corpus using keyword search plus your IE outputs or a shallow semantic index.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- **Reflection:** In a short note, compare rule‑based IE with learned models and explain how these ideas relate to retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG) with LLMs.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/newchap00.pdf)​
