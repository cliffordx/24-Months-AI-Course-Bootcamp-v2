## Week 59 – Deep RL concept bridge

- **Reading:** Re‑read the **function approximation** section of Chapter 22 plus relevant deep‑learning parts of Chapter 21 that mention RL (e.g., DQN‑style architectures) and skim external summaries of deep RL if needed.aima.berkeley+1​

- **Coding:**

   - Using a high‑level RL library (if available), run a **DQN or policy‑gradient** example in a simple environment (e.g., CartPole) to see deep RL in action without worrying about low‑level implementation details.aibars+1​

   - Inspect network architectures, loss curves, and learned policies.[aikosh.indiaai](https://aikosh.indiaai.gov.in/static/Deep+Learning+Ian+Goodfellow.pdf)​

- **Reflection:** Write a concept note connecting classical RL algorithms from AIMA to modern deep RL (DQN, actor–critic), explaining what changes when neural networks approximate value/policy functions.aikosh.indiaai+1​
