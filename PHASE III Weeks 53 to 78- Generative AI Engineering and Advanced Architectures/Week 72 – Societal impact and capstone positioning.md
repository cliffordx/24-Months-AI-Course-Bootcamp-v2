## Week 72 – Societal impact and capstone positioning

- **Reading:** Finish Chapter 27 and optionally skim Chapter 28 “The Future of AI” for perspectives on long‑term trajectories and open problems.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- **Coding / exercises:**

   - Draft a **capstone design document**: describe the problem, user context, classical AI components (search/planning/MDP/BNs), data and learning components (ML/DL/RL), and any LLM or external tools.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/newchap00.pdf)​

   - Identify specific metrics (task success, safety constraints, explanation quality) and possible datasets/simulators you will use.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- **Reflection:** Write a “State of my AI journey” note, connecting all AIMA parts—agents, search, logic, planning, probability, learning, deep learning, RL, NLP, vision, robotics, ethics—and articulate how your capstone will showcase a **hybrid classical + modern AI system** that is technically solid and safety‑aware.[lib.ysu+1](http://lib.ysu.am/disciplines_bk/efdd4d1d4c2087fe1cbe03d9ced67f34.pdf)​
