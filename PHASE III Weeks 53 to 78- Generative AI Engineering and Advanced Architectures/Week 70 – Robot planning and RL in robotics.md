## Week 70 – Robot planning and RL in robotics

- **Reading:** Chapter 26 sections that cover robot motion planning, mapping, and the application of reinforcement learning to robotics.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/newchap00.pdf)​

- **Coding / exercises:**

   - Implement a simple **motion planner** (grid‑based A\* or RRT‑like idea) in your 2‑D robot world, integrating obstacles and kinematic constraints if possible.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

   - If feasible, connect your RL code (e.g., Q‑learning) to the robot simulator for a simple navigation or docking task with rewards.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- **Reflection:** Write a short comparison of classical planning vs. RL approaches for robot control and where a hybrid (planner suggests path, RL refines controllers) makes sense.[lib.ysu+1](http://lib.ysu.am/disciplines_bk/efdd4d1d4c2087fe1cbe03d9ced67f34.pdf)​
