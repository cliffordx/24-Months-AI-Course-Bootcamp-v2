## Week 67 – Geometry and multi‑view vision

- **Reading:** Chapter 25 sections on **3D perception**, stereo, motion, and multi‑view geometry (focus on conceptual understanding rather than heavy math).[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- **Coding / exercises:**

   - Use a vision library to compute **optical flow** or simple stereo disparity on a small video or image pair to get a feel for motion/depth cues.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

   - Visualize results and see where they succeed or fail (e.g., textureless regions, occlusions).[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- **Reflection:** In ½–1 page, explain how geometric reasoning about the world connects to robotics and planning, and how deep models approximate such reasoning in modern systems.[lib.ysu+1](http://lib.ysu.am/disciplines_bk/efdd4d1d4c2087fe1cbe03d9ced67f34.pdf)​
