## Week 71 – Philosophy, ethics, and safety of AI

- **Reading:** Chapter 27 “Philosophy, Ethics, and Safety of AI” sections on philosophical foundations (mind, consciousness), ethical concerns, fairness, and safety issues (e.g., reward misspecification, instrumental convergence).[scribd+1](https://www.scribd.com/presentation/823995840/chapter27-4e)​

- **Coding / exercises:**

   - Take one of your existing agents (search planner, RL agent, or LLM‑assisted pipeline) and analyze where **specification gaming** or unintended behavior could arise; write small counterexamples or simulations demonstrating such failure modes.[scribd+1](https://www.scribd.com/presentation/823995840/chapter27-4e)​

   - Implement simple guardrails or constraints (e.g., state/action restrictions, reward shaping, or rule‑based checks) and test whether they mitigate the issues.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- **Reflection:** In 1–2 pages, reflect on the ethical/safety themes most relevant to your planned capstone (e.g., data privacy, bias, unsafe exploration, over‑reliance on LLMs) and list concrete mitigations you can build into your design.[scribd+1](https://www.scribd.com/presentation/823995840/chapter27-4e)​
