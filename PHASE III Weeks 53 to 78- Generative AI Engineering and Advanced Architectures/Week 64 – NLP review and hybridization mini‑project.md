## Week 64 – NLP review and hybridization mini‑project

- **Reading:** Light review of key parts of Chapter 23 and any Chapter 24 sections that anchor deep NLP concepts you are using (e.g., embeddings, sequence models).[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- **Coding / exercises:**

   - Combine **classical NLP** (parsing/IE) with a small neural or LLM component: for example, parse and extract structured facts, then feed them to a simple classifier or planner.[lib.ysu+1](http://lib.ysu.am/disciplines_bk/efdd4d1d4c2087fe1cbe03d9ced67f34.pdf)​

   - Evaluate task performance with and without the classical component to see its contribution to robustness or interpretability.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- **Reflection:** Create a “NLP toolkit” summary: tokenization, parsing, semantics, IE, and deep NLP, and sketch where each piece might sit in your eventual capstone pipeline.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​
