## Week 73 – Finalize capstone problem and requirements

- **Reading (1–2 sessions):** Re‑read the introductions and summaries of Chapters 1, 11, 17, 22, 23, and 27–28 to ground your capstone in AIMA’s framing of agents, planning, decision making, learning, language, and safety.lib.ysu+2​

- **Coding / design (1–2 sessions):**

   - Choose a concrete capstone theme (e.g., task‑planning assistant, tutoring agent, decision‑support tool) that clearly needs both **symbolic reasoning** (search/logic/planning) and learned components (ML/DL/RL/LLM).guvi+2​

   - Draft a requirements document: target users, inputs/outputs, constraints, success metrics, and which AIMA components will appear where (e.g., planning module based on Ch. 11, RL decision module from Ch. 22, NLP/LLM front‑end from Ch. 23–24).projectpro+2​

- **Reflection:** In 1–2 pages, explain why this problem is interesting, how it showcases the breadth of AIMA 4e, and what risks or unknowns you anticipate (technical and ethical).studocu+2​
