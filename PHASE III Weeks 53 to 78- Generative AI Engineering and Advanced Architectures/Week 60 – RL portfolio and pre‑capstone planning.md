## Week 60 – RL portfolio and pre‑capstone planning

- **Reading:** Light review of all of Chapter 22 and your notes from Weeks 49–59; briefly peek at Chapter 23’s introduction to see how RL‑driven agents may interact with language‑based interfaces.aima.berkeley+1​

- **Coding / exercises:**

   - Clean up your RL code into a small **library** (tabular RL, approximate RL, hybrid planning+RL) with clear interfaces and documentation, so it can be reused in your capstone.stonybrook+1​

   - Choose 1–2 RL setups (e.g., gridworld navigation, bandits for recommendation, or resource allocation) that could plausibly reappear inside your eventual capstone system.aima.berkeley+1​

- **Reflection:** Create a “Capstone RL components” design note: list which RL/MDP pieces you might embed in a future LLM‑assisted agent (e.g., RL for tool selection, planning under uncertainty, or adaptive decision making) and how they will interact with symbolic planning and NLP modules starting in Week 61.aima.berkeley+2​
