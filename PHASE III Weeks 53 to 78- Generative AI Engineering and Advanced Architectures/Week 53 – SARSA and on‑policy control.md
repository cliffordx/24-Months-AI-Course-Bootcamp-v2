## Week 53 – SARSA and on‑policy control

- **Reading (1–2 sessions):** Chapter 22 section 22.6 on **on‑policy control**, focusing on SARSA (State–Action–Reward–State–Action).aima.berkeley+1​

- **Coding (1–2 sessions):**

   - Implement **SARSA** for gridworld with ε‑greedy exploration and learn an action‑value function Q(s,a)Q(s,a)Q(s,a).stonybrook+1​

   - Compare learned policies for different ε schedules (e.g., constant vs. decaying ε) and document their effect on performance and stability.modanesh.github+1​

- **Reflection:** In ½ page, explain why SARSA is considered on‑policy and how its updates incorporate the behavior policy’s future actions.aima.berkeley+1​
