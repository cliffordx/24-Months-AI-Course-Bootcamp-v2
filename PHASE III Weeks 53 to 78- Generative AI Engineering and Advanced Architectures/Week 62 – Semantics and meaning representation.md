## Week 62 – Semantics and meaning representation

- **Reading:** Chapter 23 sections on **semantics**, meaning representation, compositionality, first‑order representations of meaning, and semantic roles.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- **Coding / exercises:**

   - Extend your Week‑61 parser or write a separate module that maps simple sentences into FOL‑style logical forms (or predicate structures) based on the grammar.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

   - Implement a toy **semantic role labeler** for a tiny verb lexicon by pattern‑matching parse trees to extract agent/patient roles.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- **Reflection:** Write about the connection between meaning representations in NLP and the FOL/knowledge‑representation machinery you studied earlier, and how they could feed into a knowledge base.[lib.ysu+1](http://lib.ysu.am/disciplines_bk/efdd4d1d4c2087fe1cbe03d9ced67f34.pdf)​
