## Week 68 – Vision review and integrated perception mini‑project

- **Reading:** Quick review of Chapter 25 and skim any remaining sections on “Understanding what people are doing” and “Linking pictures and words.”[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- **Coding / exercises:**

   - Build a small **perception demo**: for example, an image tagging tool, a simple detector for a few object categories, or a vision front‑end that produces symbols (labels, bounding boxes) for use by a planning or decision module.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

   - Log predictions and create a few error case studies to understand failure modes.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- **Reflection:** Write a “Vision in my capstone” note: how might a vision component (even if via an API) provide inputs to your future hybrid classical/LLM agent.[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/newchap00.pdf)​
