## Week 65 – Image formation and basic vision tasks

- **Reading (1–2 sessions):** Chapter 25 “Computer Vision” sections on image formation, camera models, and basic vision tasks (edge detection, segmentation, recognition).[aima.berkeley+1](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)​

- **Coding / exercises (1–2 sessions):**

   - Using OpenCV or a similar library, load images and implement simple preprocessing: grayscale conversion, edge detection (Canny), and threshold‑based segmentation.[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

   - Experiment with these operations on images related to your interests (e.g., property photos, street scenes).[aima.berkeley](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html)​

- **Reflection:** Write in your notes how low‑level image processing relates to the higher‑level perception pipeline described in the chapter and how deep CNNs can replace or augment many hand‑crafted stages.[lib.ysu+1](http://lib.ysu.am/disciplines_bk/efdd4d1d4c2087fe1cbe03d9ced67f34.pdf)​
