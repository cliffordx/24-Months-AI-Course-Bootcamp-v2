## Week 55 – Eligibility traces and n‑step methods (optional depth)

- **Reading:** Chapter 22 section 22.7 on **eligibility traces** and nnn-step TD methods (if this section feels heavy, read for intuition rather than full proofs).aima.berkeley+1​

- **Coding:**

   - Implement a simple **TD(λ)** or nnn-step TD variant for prediction in a 1‑D random walk or basic chain environment, comparing learning speed to TD(0).stonybrook+1​

   - Optionally, extend SARSA or Q‑learning with eligibility traces in a small environment and examine the impact on convergence speed.aima.berkeley+1​

- **Reflection:** Summarize in your notes how eligibility traces unify MC and TD, and under what circumstances you might choose λ close to 0 or 1.modanesh.github+1​
